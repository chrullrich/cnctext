Situation
=========

- Total available width: 22.5 mm
- Total available height: 6.5 mm
- Font size (x height): 2.8 mm
- Inter-line spacing: 0.5 mm (leaves 0.4 mm for line 2 descenders)
  - Must be validated once scaled characters available


Line Format
===========

A line consists of text, arranged in one or two columns. The first
column is left-aligned in the output. If a second column is present,
it is right-aligned.

Because the HT character is already used for another purpose (as
column separator in a text input file that has one label per physical
line and the two label lines in HT-separated columns), the intra-line
column separator is any sequence of more than one consecutive SP.
(Alternatively, US (0x1f) could be used, as it is attractively close
to SP in the code table.)


Procedure
=========

- Determine:

  - Total width of characters in line (excluding a column gap)
  - Presence of column gap

- If column gap is present, reduce available width for line by 2 mm.

- Calculate horizontal scaling factor (sx = available/total) required
  to fit characters into available width.

- Calculate vertical scaling factor (sy = available/font size)
  required to fit line into available height.

- If (sx > 1.15sy) [characters more than 15 % narrower than designed],
  abort with error.

- If (sx < 0.85sy) [characters more than 15 % wider than designed],
  set sx := 0.85sy [do not stretch to maximum for legibility]
  
- Recalculate column gap (cg = 22.5mm - (total character width * sx)).
  [Will be wider than 2mm if (sx < 0.85sy before previous step, 2mm
   otherwise.]

- Create galley:

  (Place scaled/translated characters in list. Transformation can
  scale and translate at once, but how to arrange the operation so
  that per-character x offset is available? Use translation only for y
  and do the x later?)

  (Place characters to left of column gap, then skip column gap and
  continue with second column; the result will be right aligned even
  though placed from the left.)
